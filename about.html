                    <p> I was born, raised, and lived most of my life in Moscow. Being a natural Moscow person means being quick in everything!  In making decisions, in lifestyle, in your career. Moscow is a high-speed and dynamic city, and I love it. That's why when I came to New York, I fell in love with this city. New York has the same vibe plus unique energy and charm.</p> 

                    <p>I practiced law for many years in Moscow before coming to the U.S. In 2010 I was one of the "10 Most Successful Lawyers in Moscow".
                    But looking at my whole life story, I realized - I was ready to write a new chapter.</p>



                    <p>And a new story began.
                    When researching a new career, I knew I wanted to leverage my passion and my experience. I have always loved the design, fashion, and art.</p>
                     <p>My "Aha" moment occurred when I realized that there is a career where I can combine my passion and my experience - this is UX Design.</p>



                    <p>The work of a lawyer involves the same process as a UX Design -  "Double Diamond." 

                    The process of a lawyer's work is to:

                    Discover (identify all pain points and problems of the case), 

                    Define (develop a strategy and methods),

                    Design (create a case story), 

                        Deliver (to convince the court and judge and win :)</p>
                    <p>And... here I am!</p>
